= frontend

I assume java dev kit and runtime is installed and you are running under nix like OS.

== run the computer ship user interface

to run the frontend, launch this command in the terminal and go to http://localhost:8000
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew c3po
----
to stop c3p0 use Ctrl+C +

if the port is already running, just type this command to kill it.
[source,bash]
----
killall node
----
