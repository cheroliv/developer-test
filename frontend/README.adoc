= frontend

I assume java dev kit and runtime is installed and you are running under nix like OS.

== run the computer ship user interface

to run the frontend, launch this command in the terminal and go to http://localhost:8000
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :backend:c3po
----

if the port is already running, just type this command to kill it.
[source,bash]
----
killall node
----
